- There can be a lag as long as twice the interval in corner cases
- In cases of poor logging density, consecutive intervals may be separated
- Doesn't answear the question of WHERE the problem is. Helps to answear WHEN.
- Hardcoded regex that matches only specific nginx log of format:
a snippet from nginx.conf:
log_format beholder_log_format '[$time_local] $remote_addr (#$connection_requests) "$request_method $request_truncated HTTP/1.1" request_time: $request_time status: $status bytes: $bytes_sent "$request" to: $upstream_addr upstream_response_time: $upstream_response_time';
- very poor set of stats
- quite a bit of code-repetitions in interval_stats_collector
